# Dotfiles

This is a collection of my dotfiles. I use [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage them.

## Installation

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/asger-noer/dotfiles.git

# Change to the dotfiles directory
cd dotfiles

# Stow the dotfiles to the home directory
stow --dotfiles -t ~ .
```
